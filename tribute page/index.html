                                                       Civilian Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw
                                                       how food changed them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."

                                                       budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to
                                                       school study under Stakman, who teaches him about breeding
